## Onboarding Users onto Server using Shell Script

### The objective of this project is to create a shell script that can read a .csv file of names of users to be onboarded.

##### Create a directory called 'Shell'
```
mkdir Shell
```

```
cd Shell
```

##### Next, make a file called 'names.csv' and add a random list of names to it
```
vi names.csv
```
```
