### Ansible Refactoring & Static Assignments (Imports and Roles)

This project builds upon the previous project by making improvements of the code and working with the ansible-config-mgt repository. The tasks in this project include refactoring the code, creating assignments and learning to use the imports functionality. Imports allow to effectively re-use previously created playbooks in a new playbook - it allows to organize tasks and reuse them when needed.

For better understanding or Ansible artifacts re-use, refer to [ansible docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse.html)

##### Code Refactoring

Refactoring is a general term in computer programming. It means making changes to the source code without changing expected behaviour of the software. The main idea of refactoring is to enhance code readability, increase maintainability and extensibility, reduce complexity, add proper comments without affecting the logic.

In this project, the primary objective is to improve the Ansible code by moving things around a little bit but the overall state of the infrastructure remains the same.

##### Step 1 - Jenkins job enhancement
