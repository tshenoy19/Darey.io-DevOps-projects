### Ansible Refactoring & Static Assignments (Imports and Roles)

This project builds upon the previous project by making improvements of the code and working with the ansible-config-mgt repository. The tasks in this project include refactoring the code, creating assignments and learning to use the imports functionality. Imports allow to effectively re-use previously created playbooks in a new playbook - it allows to organize tasks and reuse them when needed.

For better understanding or Ansible artifacts re-use, refer to [ansible docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse.html)
